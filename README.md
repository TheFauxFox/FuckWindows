# FuckWindows

I typically hate setting up Windows 10 environments. This is due to plenty of factors, but the main parts are:
* I hate Windows SmartScreen
* I hate Windows Defender
* I hate telemetry
* I hate bloatware
* I hate Windows
* I don't want to pay for activation *don't steal software, this is satire*

This will be my fun new script to setup Windows 10 to the same, semi-debloated -- yet still functional -- state every time.

I am not very proficient in C++, so bear with me if there's a "more optimized" or "better way" to do things. I'm just having fun with a language I can make an EXE out of, that can do everything I need, without any prerequisites.

This will probably never recieve updates unless either
* I find a fun new thing to add to it (tweak, telemetry disable)
* I try to setup a new Windows box and something goes horribly wrong
* I think of something I'm missing

Don't expect anything great from this project.
