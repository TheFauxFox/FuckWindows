# FuckWindows

I typically hate setting up Windows 10 environments. This is due to plenty of factors, but the main parts are:
* I hate Windows SmartScreen
* I hate Windows Defender
* I hate telemetry
* I hate bloatware
* I hate Windows
* I don't want to pay for activation

This will be my fun new script to setup Windows 10 to the same, semi-debloated -- yet still functional -- state every time.

I am not very proficient in C++, so bear with me if there's a "more optimized" or "better way" to do things. I'm just having fun with a language I can make an EXE out of, that can do everything I need, without any prerequisites.
